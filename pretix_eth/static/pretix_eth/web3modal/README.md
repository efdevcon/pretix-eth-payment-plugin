# How to make changes to the web3modal integration:
1) setup: npm install
2) npm run dev

Make sure to push the generated files after any changes (web3modal-dist folder) as we currently don't have this included in the build pipeline (which would also require us to set up
a way to run this automatically when running the payment plugin locally/for dev)
